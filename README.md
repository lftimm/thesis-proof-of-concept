# Thesis proof of concept

Proof of concept for my Bachelors' Thesis. Using vertex shaders, i simulate how a beam would behave while under a single point load, showing the elastic deform curve as a deform.

I studied the basic of three.js for this, while also understanding better how to utilize shaders, with uniforms and attributes.
Actually implemented a lighting model for this from scratch, for learning sake.
